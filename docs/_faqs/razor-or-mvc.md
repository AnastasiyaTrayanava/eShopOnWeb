title: "When should I use MVC and when should I use Razor Pages? This repo does both!"
---

This app could be done completely in one way or the other, but as this is a demo app we're trying to show how it's done in each. This way you can see the advantages / disadvantages of each. A few years ago in this project we tried to maintain two separate projects - 1 for just MVC and 1 for just Razor pages. It was difficult to maintain both, so we combined the projects.
